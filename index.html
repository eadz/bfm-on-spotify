        <h3>bFM on Spotify</h3>

<p>bFM does a great job at playing great music. I can't listen to bFM 24/7, so I made a <em>computer/programming thingy</em> that goes to the bFM page, get all the songs from the playlists, searches spotify for the song, then for each DJ/Show makes a playlist of the most recent 50 or so songs.</p>

<p>This is that <em>computer/programming thingy</em>.</p>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<p><i>these playlists are neither 100% accurate nor 100% complete.</i></p>
<p>Many artists &mdash; especially some of the awesome NZ ones &mdash; are not on spotify.</p>
<p>Also, the computer gets it wrong sometimes, REALLY WRONG, no, the DJ didn't play Body Count by Justin Timberlake rather the self titled track... bear that in mind. Zac &amp; Ethan's playlist is really really broken ( no they didn't play that track! ), I'll fix it soon.</p>
<p>Finally, this is not authorized or endorsed by bFM, I'm not sure what they'll think of it this stage. Comments or suggestions &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/eadz">@eadz</a></p>


  <h3>The Playlists</h3>
    <p>Note, you'll need spotify to listen...</p>
