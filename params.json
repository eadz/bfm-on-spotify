Good is only good for the first 30 plays. bFM does a great job at playing great music. I made a *computer thingy* that goes to the bFM page, get all the songs from the playlists, searches spotify for the song, then for each DJ/Show makes a playlist of the most recent 30 or so songs.\r\n\r\nThis is that thingy.\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nDoes this break copyright?
